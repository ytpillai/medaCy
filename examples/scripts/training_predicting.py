# Will build a model named model_name with the pipeline and parameters defined below. This script places the model in
# it's own directory along the models build log and model/pipeline parameters to keep results easily referencable during run time.
# Once a sufficent model is produced, consider wrapping it up into a medaCy compatible model as defined the example guide.
