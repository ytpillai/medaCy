source_text = """ABELCET (Amphotericin B Lipid Complex Injection)DESCRIPTIONABELCET  is a sterile, pyrogen-free suspension for intravenous infusion.
ABELCET  consists of ampho-tericin B complexed with two phospholipids in a 1:1 drug-to-lipid molar ratio.
The two phospholipids,L-&#x3b1;-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and L-&#x3b1;-dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG), are pre-sent in a 7:3 molar ratio.
ABELCET  is yellow and opaque in appearance, with a pH of 5 - 7.
NOTE: Liposomal encapsulation or incorporation in a lipid complex can substantially affect adrug's functional properties relative to those of the unencapsulated or nonlipid-associated drug.
Inaddition, different liposomal or lipid-complexed products with a common active ingredient mayvary from one another in the chemical composition and physical form of the lipid component.
Suchdifferences may affect functional properties of these drug products.Amphotericin B is a polyene, antifungal antibiotic produced from a strain of Streptomyces nodosus.Amphotericin B is designated chemically as [1R-(1R*, 3S*, 5R*, 6R*, 9R*, 11R*, 15S*, 16R*, 17R*,18S*, 19E, 21E, 23E, 25E, 27E, 29E, 31E, 33R*, 35S*, 36R*, 37S*)]-33-[(3-Amino-3, 6- D-mannopyranosyl) oxy]-1,3,5,6,9,11,17,37-octahydroxy-15,16,18-trimethyl-13-oxo-14,39-dioxabicy-clo[33.3.1] nonatriaconta-19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31-heptaene-36-carboxylic acid.
It has a molecular weight of 924.09 and a molecular formula of C47H73NO17.
The structural formula is:
ABELCET  is provided as a sterile, opaque suspension in 20 mL glass, single-use vials.
